  Summary of the analytics:
  This jupyter notebook organized and cleaned data as a way to showcase and compare school data. This data compared district schools to charter schools. This data also compared "school success" by means of reading & math scores, through the lense of school budgets, and school size. 


  Conclusions from calculations
   1) An argument is often made that schools that have more funding perform better than others. When I took a look at the data, I saw that Huang High School has the largest budget per student, but is ranked as one of the lowest-performing schools by % overall passing. This result could challenge that argument.

      
   2) Looking at this data, parents that want their children to attend better-performing schools, should consider Charter Schools. They have lower student counts than district schools, therefore, in theory, allow teachers to dedicate more time with individual students. Charter Schools have proven to yield better reading and math scores, as well as higher overall passing rates.
